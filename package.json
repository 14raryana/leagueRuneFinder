  "description": "Playing league of legends is one of my favorite things to do.  I am not a pro by any means, but I do know my way around the rift.  One thing that has always bothered me is finding the correct runes to go.  In the middle of champion select I always have to open the web browser, type the url, search for the correct champion and read off from the list what the runes have to be.  I hate doing this with a burning passion so I decided to create a simple web scraping program to help me find the runes faster.  I am aware that there are such programs as Blitz out there that put in your runes automatically, but from my experience, they tend to mess up a lot of times.   This web scraping app can be used through the terminal, using commands.  The user will input the champion name, along with the role they want the champion to go, and the program will return the correct runes and items to build for that specific champion.  All in the terminal, so there will be no to look at unnecessary pictures and other decorative things.",
